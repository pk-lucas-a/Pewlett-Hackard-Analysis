# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
Pewlett Hackard has requested an internal employee analysis to prepare for a high percentage of upcoming retirements. First, the analysis filtered employees to identify those nearing retirement. Then these were grouped by title to see how many employees may be retiring from each position. Finally, to mitigate the impact of losing the most experienced employees, two department managers requested information to prepare to pitch a mentorship program to the CEO. 
## Results
- We have extracted seven different position titles held by the specified age group.
